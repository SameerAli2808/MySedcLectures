Make a layout for a site about ancient Egypt. 
Put a header, a nav bar in the left region and a footer.
Make the header and footer one colour and put a background image to the content part of the web page. 
In the nav bar put some menu items which will lead you to different sections of the page.
Put some hyperlinks throughout the page that will lead to different web sites, content related.
