Try and recreate the layout shown on the image. Try to use appropriate HTML5 elements where possible instead of divs.

Hint: Read about the 'float'property, it will be helpful here. We'll learn it on next class (9.12) so no worries if you don't understand it. 

p.s. Ignore the "Activate Windows" sign at the bottom right corner :))
